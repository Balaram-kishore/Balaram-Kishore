<h2 align="center">Hi 👋, 👋 Hi there! I'm Swetha Kanala – Cloud DevOps Engineer based in canada</h2>
<h2 align="center">"DevOps Engineer"</h2

👨‍💻  Welcome to my GitHub! With over 4 years of experience in building, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructure, I’m passionate about creating scalable, efficient, and reliable systems. My journey started in QA, where I honed my troubleshooting skills and deepened my understanding of the software development lifecycle. Today, I specialize in modern DevOps practices, cloud-native solutions, and driving automation to empower teams and businesses.

🌟 Career Highlights
Here are a few of my proudest accomplishments:

At Stratosfy, I automated deployment pipelines and reduced deployment times by 40% while implementing Kubernetes clusters with 99.9% uptime SLA.
For stratosfy, I led a Terraform-based automation project that cut manual effort by 20%.
I’ve also designed and implemented robust monitoring systems using Prometheus and Grafana, improving issue detection time by 50%.
Additionally, I hold certifications like AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, Terraform Certified Associate, and Azure administrative associate, which validate my expertise in cloud and DevOps technologies.

🚀 Professional Projects
I believe projects tell stories of growth, problem-solving, and impact. Here are some highlights from mine:

Scalable CI/CD Pipeline Automation: I built a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Kubernetes, and AWS. This effort reduced deployment failures by 30% and improved deployment speed across multiple microservices.
Infrastructure as Code for Multi-Cloud Deployment: Using Terraform and Ansible, I deployed consistent multi-cloud infrastructure for staging and production environments.
Monitoring and Logging System: I set up a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system using Prometheus and Grafana, giving teams real-time insights and drastically reducing incident response times.

🌱 Always Learning
Curiosity is what keeps me going. Right now, I’m diving deeper into advanced Kubernetes concepts like Operators and exploring service mesh technologies like Istio. I’m also experimenting with serverless frameworks, including AWS SAM and Google Cloud Functions, to expand my horizons in cloud-native development.

💡 Fun Fact
I transitioned from QA to DevOps, and it’s been an exciting journey! My early experience gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving, which I now apply to building resilient, scalable systems. When I’m not working, you’ll find me exploring emerging technologies or mentoring others who are starting their own DevOps journey.
