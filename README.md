<h2 align="center">👋 Hi there! I'm Swetha Kanala – Cloud DevOps Engineer based in canada</h2>
<h2 align="center">"DevOps Engineer"</h2

👨‍💻  Welcome to my GitHub! With over 4 years of experience in building, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructure, I’m passionate about creating scalable, efficient, and reliable systems. My journey started in QA, where I honed my troubleshooting skills and deepened my understanding of the software development lifecycle. Today, I specialize in modern DevOps practices, cloud-native solutions, and driving automation to empower teams and businesses.

🌟 Career Highlights
Here are a few of my proudest accomplishments:

At Stratosfy, I automated deployment pipelines and reduced deployment times by 40% while implementing Kubernetes clusters with 99.9% uptime SLA.
For stratosfy, I led a Terraform-based automation project that cut manual effort by 20%.
I’ve also designed and implemented robust monitoring systems using Prometheus and Grafana, improving issue detection time by 50%.
Additionally, I hold certifications like AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, Terraform Certified Associate, and Azure administrative associate, which validate my expertise in cloud and DevOps technologies.

🌱 Always Learning
Curiosity is what keeps me going. Right now, I’m diving deeper into advanced Kubernetes concepts like Operators and exploring service mesh technologies like Istio. I’m also experimenting with serverless frameworks, including AWS SAM and Google Cloud Functions, to expand my horizons in cloud-native development.

🤝 I'm open to collaborating on Cloud Infrastructure Projects: Building scalable and secure cloud environments using AWS, Azure, and Terraform. CI/CD Implementation: Designing and optimizing CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins to improve software delivery speed and reliability. Containerization Solutions: Developing and managing containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes to enhance deployment and scalability. DevOps Automation: Automating infrastructure tasks, configuration management, and monitoring to streamline operations and improve efficiency. Technical Blogging: Co-authoring blogs or articles on topics related to DevOps, cloud automation, Docker, or Kubernetes to share knowledge and insights.

⚡ Open to Learning New Tools & Technologies: I enjoy exploring emerging tools and platforms in DevOps, cloud computing, and automation to stay ahead in the industry. Mentorship: I am passionate about mentoring budding DevOps engineers, guiding them through cloud concepts, CI/CD, and best practices in automation. Hackathons & Events: I am enthusiastic about participating in hackathons, conferences, and tech meetups to collaborate, learn, and share insights with the community. Feedback & Improvement: I am always open to feedback to enhance my skills and contribute better to cloud projects and team efforts.
