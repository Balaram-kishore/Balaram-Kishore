👨‍💻  Welcome to my GitHub! With over 5+  years of experience in building, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructure, I’m passionate about creating scalable, efficient, and reliable systems. My journey started as Build/Release Engineer, where I honed my troubleshooting skills and deepened my understanding of the software development lifecycle. Today, I specialize in modern DevOps practices, cloud-native solutions, and driving automation to empower teams and businesses.

🌟 Career Highlights:

At Stratosfy, I automated deployment pipelines and reduced deployment times by 40% while implementing Kubernetes clusters with 99.9% uptime SLA.
For Stratosfy, I led a Terraform-based automation project that cut manual effort by 20%.
I’ve also designed and implemented robust monitoring systems using Prometheus and Grafana, improving issue detection time by 50%.
Additionally, I hold certifications such as AWS Certified Solutions Architect—Associate, Azure Administrator Associate, and Managing Cloud-native Applications with Kubernetes Red Hat validates my expertise in cloud and DevOps technologies.

🤝 I'm open to collaborating on the following areas:

Cloud Infrastructure Projects: Designing and implementing scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud environments using AWS, Azure, and Terraform to support business growth and resilience.
CI/CD Implementation: Building and fine-tuning CI/CD pipelines with tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins to streamline software delivery and enhance reliability.
Containerization and Orchestration: Developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes to ensure scalability, flexibility, and optimized performance.
DevOps Automation: Automating infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and monitoring processes to improve operational efficiency and reduce manual workloads.
Technical Writing and Blogging: Collaborating on articles or blogs about DevOps practices, cloud automation, containerization, or Kubernetes to share knowledge and foster community learning.

⚡ Open to Learning New Tools & Technologies: 

I enjoy staying ahead in the industry by exploring the latest tools and platforms in DevOps, cloud computing, and automation.
Mentorship: I’m passionate about mentoring aspiring DevOps engineers, helping them grasp cloud concepts, master CI/CD processes, and adopt best practices in automation.
Hackathons & Events: I thrive on participating in hackathons, conferences, and tech meetups to collaborate with peers, learn new trends, and share knowledge with the community.
Continuous Improvement: I value constructive feedback as an opportunity to refine my skills and make meaningful contributions to cloud projects and team success.
